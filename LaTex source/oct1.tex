\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $A$ be the collection of finite unions of sets of the form $(a, b] \cap \Q$ where $-\infty \leq a < b \leq \infty$.
\subitem(a) Prove that $A$ is an algebra on $\Q$.
\begin{proof}
Notice $A$ is closed under finite unions and is nonempty, so we need only check this $A$ is closed under finite complements. 	
\end{proof}
\subitem(b) Prove that the $\sa$ generated by $A$ is the power set of $\Q$.
\begin{proof}
	Consider any $q \in \Q$. Then, $q = \cap_{n=1}^\infty (q - \frac{1}{n}, q]$.
\end{proof}
 \subitem(c) Define $\mu_0$ on $A$ by $\mu_0(\o)=0$ and $\mu_0(E)= \infty$ if $E \neq \o$. Prove $\mu_0$ is a pre measure on $A$. 	
 \begin{proof}
 All things in A are nonempty so union nonempty, so measure is infinite. 	
 \end{proof}

 \subitem(d) Prove that there is more than one measure on $P(\Q)$ whose restriction to $A$ is $\mu_0$.
 counting measure
 
 \subitem(e) Why does this not contradict Theorem 1.14?
 $\mu_0$ is not $\sigma$-finite. 
 
 $\S$ 2.5 up to prop 2.34
