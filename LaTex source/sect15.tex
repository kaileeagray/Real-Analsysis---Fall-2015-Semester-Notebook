\begin{dfn}A Borel measure is any measure $\mu$ defined on the $\sa$ of Borel sets. 
\end{dfn}

\begin{thm} If $F: \R \rightarrow \R$ is any increasing, right continuous function, there is a unique Borel measure $\mu_F$ on $\R$ such that $\mu_F((a,b])=F(b)-F(a)$ for all $a,b$. \\
If $G$ is another such function, we have $\mu_F= \mu_G$ iff $F-G$ is constant.\\
Conversely, if $\mu$ is a Borel measure on $\R$ that is finite on all bounded Borel sets and we define
\[ F(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
	\mu((0, x]) & \text{ if } x>0\\
	0 & \text{ if } x=0\\
	-\mu((x, 0]) & \text{ if } x<0
\end{array} \right. 
\]	
then $F$ is increasing and right continuous and $\mu=\mu_F$.
\end{thm}

\begin{dfn}[$\B_\R$]
	Borel $\sa$: generated by family of open sets in $\R$ (or closed, half-open, open rays, closed rays
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure]
	For any $E \in \M_\mu$, \[
	\mu(E) = \inf \left\{ \sum_1^\infty \mu((a_j, b_j)): E \subset  \bigcup_1^\infty (a_j, b_j)  \right\}.
	\]
\end{dfn}

\begin{thm}
If $E \in \M_\mu$, then \[
\mu(E) = \inf \{ \mu(U): U \supset E, \ U \text{ open} \} = \sup \{ \mu(K) : K \subset E, \ K \text{ compact} \}
\]
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
\[
E \subset \R. \quad E \in \M_\mu \iff E = V \slash N_1, \ V \text{ is }  G_\delta, \mu(N_1)= 0 \iff E = H \cup N_2, \ H \text{ is }  F_\sigma, \ \mu(N_2)=0.
\]	
\end{thm}

\begin{dfn}[Lebesgue measure]
	Complete measure $\mu_F$ associated to the function $F(x) = x$ for which the measure of an interval is simply its length. Denoted $m$.
\end{dfn}
\begin{rmk}
$m$ is invariant under translations, simple behavior under dilations: $m(E + s) = m(E)$ and $m(rE) = |r|m(E)$	
\end{rmk}

\begin{rmk}
Every singleton set in $\R $ has Lebesgue measure zero.	Every countable set has Lebesgue measure zero.
