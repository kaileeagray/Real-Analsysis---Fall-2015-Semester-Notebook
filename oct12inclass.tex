$\mu_F$ Borel measure
Theorem: TFAE	
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(a)] $E \in \M_{\mu_F}$
	\item[(b)] $E = V \backslash N_1$, $\mu_F(N_1)=0$, $V$ is $G_\delta$
	\item[(c)] $E = H \cup N_2$, $\mu_F(N_2)=0$, $H$ is $F_\sigma$
\end{enumerate}

$\B_\R \subseteq \M_{\mu_F}$
\\
Thm: $E \in \M_{\mu_F}$ implies $\mu_F(E)=\inf\{ \mu_F(U): U $ open $ U \supseteq E\}$ and $\mu_F(E)=\sup\{\mu_F(K): K $ compact $E \subseteq K \}$. \\

Build Cantor's set.\\

$C_n$ has $2^n$ pieces consisting of closed intervals\\
\[
m(C_n) = \frac{2^n}{3^n}
\]
Cantor's set is the intersection of closed sets so it is closed
\[
C = \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty C_n; \qquad m(C) \leq m(C_n) \forall n
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n
\]
\[
CARD(C) = CARD([0,1])
\]
Every element of $C$ has a unique sequence $\{a_0, a_1, \cdots \}$ with $a_i \in \{0, 1\}$ \\
Every such sequence gives unique element of $C$. (Diagonalization proof?)\\
Assume $C$ is countable, so 

\[
x_1 = a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13},  \cdots
\]
\[
x_2 = a_{21}, a_{22}, a_{23},  \cdots
\]
\[
x_3 = a_{31}, a_{32}, a_{33},  \cdots
\]
\[
\vdots
\]
\[
x_i = \{ 0 \text{ if } a_{ii} = 1, 1 \text{ if } a_{ii}=0
\]
$C$ is closed, bounded, measure zero\\
Show your sequence if... terminates in 101 - doesn't correspond to "cut points" - only cut points, then countable\\
There are lots in $C$ of form $\frac{m}{2^k}$\\
$C$ is nowhere dense: choose $x \in C$ and any open $x \in U$, $U \cap C^c \neq \O$\\
Nowhere dense: interior of closure - $C$ is closed and no interior - no open set contained in $C$
\\
No point is isolated - given any point in $x \in C$ and $\varepsilon >0$ there is $y \in C$ such that $(x-y) < \varepsilon$. 
Something big with small measure\\
Consider the generalized Cantor set, $K$:\\
$0 < \alpha_i < 1$. Take out middle $\alpha_i$ of previous stage.\\
Set is still nowhere dense, no isolated points, cardinality same, but can tweak measure: $m(C_n)= (1-\alpha_n ) m(C_{n-1})$\\
$m(K) = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{k=1}^N (1 - \alpha_k)$
\\
Find $\alpha_k$ such that $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{k=1}^N (1 - \alpha_k)= \frac{1}{2}$ (today's exercise)
replace infite products into sum - take log of both sides\\
when does $\log(1 - \alpha_k)$ converge?
